1. generate SSL cert/key pair
	./generate_certs.sh
	this step needs to be performed only once
	(cert can be used for multiple riccis - each requires authentication)
2. modify ricci/authenticate.xml, writing root password of machine hosting ricci to 'password' attribute
3. execute `./send_to_ricci ricci_hostname ricci/authenticate.xml`
	from now on, you are authenticated to that ricci, and don't have to repeat authentication to it
4. pick/modify one of XML files
	check ../docs/ for API
5. execute `./send_to_ricci ricci_hostname xml_file`
	ricci's response will be printed to stdout

...

15. send ricci/unauthenticate.xml to unauthenticate from that ricci
